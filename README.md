## To Do

### Random

* **`[—]`** Provide alternative to ditched `unique`, such as filling a `Set` to a certain size with
  characters
* **`[—]`** Provide internal implementations that capture attempt counts for testing, better insights

### Errors

* **`[—]`** custom error base class
  * **`[—]`** or multiple ones, each derived from a built-in class such as `RangeError`, `TypeError`,
    `AggregateError`

* **`[—]`** solution to capture existing error, issue new one a la Python's `raise Error_2 from Error_1`
